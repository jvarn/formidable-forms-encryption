# Formidable Forms Encryption
A Wordpress plugin to enable encrypting and decrypting of data entered using Formidable Forms. Requires Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Plugin.
Based upon [original code](https://victorfont.com/encrypt-decrypt-formidable-form-fields/) by [Victor Font](https://github.com/vfontjr).

## Initial configuration
The following lines need to be added to wp-config.php, substituting the strings as described below.
```
define('FORMIDABLE_SALT', 'string);
define('FORMIDABLE_METHOD', 'string');
define('FORMIDABLE_OPTIONS', 0);
define('FORMIDABLE_IV', 'string');
```

### FORMIDABLE_SALT
Generate a [SALT value](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/) (choose any one and rename FORMIDABLE_SALT).

### FORMIDABLE_METHOD
Choose an appropriate [encryption method](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-get-cipher-methods.php).
e.g. AES-256-CBC

### FORMIDABLE_OPTIONS
Is 0, here’s an [explanation of openssl options](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-encrypt.php#117208).

### FORMIDABLE_IV
“A non-NULL Initialization Vector” of a particular length according to chosen encryption method
> “a random string with a length that must match the length required by your chosen cipher method. How do we know the iv length required by the chosen cipher method? We use the openssl_cipher_iv_length($cipher) function to find out.”
